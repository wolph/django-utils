Django Utils is a collection of small Django helper functions and
classes which make common patterns shorter and easier. It is by no means a
complete collection but it has served me quite a bit in the past and I will
keep extending it.

The library depends on the Python Utils library.

Documentation is available at: http://django-utils2.readthedocs.org/en/latest/
